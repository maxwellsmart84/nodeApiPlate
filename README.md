# nodeApiPlate
A boilerplate for writing a NodeJS/Express Web API with ES2017, Airbnb ESLint rules, Nodemon, and Babel.

# Installation
`npm install`

# To Dev:
`npm start`

Make sure to add .env to the .gitignore once you build - it was left there as a working example.

Tests can be ran with mocha/chai, just `npm test` to run the sample get request.
